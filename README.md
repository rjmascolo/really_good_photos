# Really Good Photos #

### What is it? ###

Really Good Photos grabs your address and then serves you photos have been taken in your surrounding area. It is great for finding new cool locations that you have never seen before. The app hooks up to the Google Maps API and allows you to see the location the photo was taken at. Also, if you see any photos you like, you can save them to be apart of your own list. Or if you want to see photos that have been in other areas, you can use the search feature to look around.

### How is it made? ###

This application is made using Ruby and HTML/CSS. The backend is running via Ruby on Rails, while the front end uses Rail's Active View feature and the CSS framework Bootstrap. It is also using two APIs, a photo sharing application called 500PX and then Google Maps.

Note: The code is hoisted on a free Heroku account so it will take a few moments for it to boot up.
